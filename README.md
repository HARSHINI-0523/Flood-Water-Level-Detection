# IoT Based Real-Time Water Level Detection and Reporting System üåäüí°

## Overview

This project presents an **IoT-based Real-Time Water Level Detection and Reporting System** designed to help flood-prone areas like Krishna Lanka near the Krishna River. The system uses **Arduino Uno**, **Bolt IoT module**, and various sensors (HC-SR04 for water level, LM35 for temperature) to monitor water levels and temperature in real-time. When water levels exceed predefined thresholds, the system triggers **visual alerts** (LEDs), **auditory alerts** (buzzer), and **SMS alerts** via **Twilio**.

The primary goal of this system is to provide early warnings to residents and authorities, enabling timely responses to minimize flood-related damage and improve disaster preparedness.

## Key Features:
- **Real-Time Water Level Monitoring**: Using an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) to measure water levels.
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Using the LM35 temperature sensor to provide local temperature data.
- **Alert Mechanisms**: Alerts via **LEDs**, **Buzzer**, and **SMS** when water levels exceed threshold values.
- **Data Logging**: Uploads water level and temperature data to **Bolt Cloud** for remote monitoring and analysis.
